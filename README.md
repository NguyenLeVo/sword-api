## Running the server
- `npm i` && `npm run seed` && `npm run start`

## Running the database
- Make sure you already have MySQL Server installed
- Either run it straight from the command like like this: `/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -p`
- Or add to your PATH this line `PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin` then just use `mysql -u root -p` to log in
